# ProgettoTimeSeries
Project for the exam Streaming Data Management and Time Series Analysis
In this project different time series forcasting models get trained to make predictions about electrical consumptions.
The first part of the project was developed using R and coonsists in a first first exploartive data analysis, followed by some preprocessing  and by the training and comparison of different ARIMA and UCM (Unobserved Component Models) models. 
A second part of the project consists in using Python to develop two recursive neural networks (LSTM and GRU) which aim to forecats the electrical consumptions.
